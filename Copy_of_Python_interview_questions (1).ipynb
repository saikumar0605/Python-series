        "1. **Why python is known as the interpreted language**\n",
        "\n",
        "->    *Interpreted in simple terms means running code line by line. It also    means that the instruction is executed without earlier compiling the whole program into machine language. Python program is converted into bytecode using the compiler that is then executed by the Python virtual machine.*\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why python is slow as compared to other languages. (C, C++)**\n",
        "-> *As Python is an interpreted language,  which means that the Python code we write must go through many, many stages of abstraction before it can become executable machine code.*\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How python assigns memory to a variable.\n",
        "-> *The memory to the variables are allocated dynamically.*\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the use case of id functions.\n",
        "-> id() is used to get the memory address of object. It always returns a unique value.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are reserve words in python?\n",
        "-> *keywords are reserved words in Python. You cannot use a keyword as a variable name. You can get all the keywords in Python using help(\"keywords\").* \n",
        "\n",
        "7. is python good for fast prototyping? if yes then how?\n",
        "-> Yes Python is good for fast prototyping. As we can quicking change the application whenever we want.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Identifiers?\n",
        "-> *Identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, etc. The identifier is a combination of character digits and underscore. The identifier should start with a character or Underscore then use a digit. The characters are A-Z or a-z, an Underscore ( _ ) , and digit (0-9).*\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Why python is called dynamically typed language?\n",
        "->  *Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.*\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What are built-in class in python?\n",
        "-> *  __dict__\tThis is a dictionary holding the class namespace.\n",
        "   ,__doc__\tThis gives us the class documentation if documentation is present. None otherwise.\n",
        "   , __name__\tThis gives us the class name.\n",
        "   , __module__\tThis gives us the name of the module in which the class is defined.\n",
        "   , __bases__\tA possibly empty tuple containing the base classes in the order of their occurrence.*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are bitwise operators in python?\n",
        "-> \t&\tBitwise AND Operator, ^\tBitwise XOR Operator, ~\tBitwise Onesâ€™ Compliment Operator, <<\tBitwise Left Shift operator, >>\tBitwise Right Shift Operator.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. difference between module package and libary?\n",
        "-> Modules -: The module is a simple Python file that contains collections of functions and global variables and with having a .py extension file.\n",
        "\n",
        "package -: The package is a simple directory having collections of modules. This directory contains Python modules and also having __init__.py file by which the interpreter interprets it as a Package.\n",
        "\n",
        "Library -: It is a reusable chunk of code that we can use by importing it in our program, we can just use it by importing that library and calling the method of that library \n",
        "\n",
        "15. what is type linting, linting in python?\n",
        "-> *Linting highlights syntactical and stylistic problems in your Python source code, which often helps you identify and correct subtle programming errors or unconventional coding practices that can lead to errors.*\n",
